# DEM Mobile App
The mobile application, developed in collaboration with DEM (Dravske elektrarne Maribor), is designed for owners of small solar power plants, providing easy access to real-time electricity production data and future forecasts. Through advanced graphs and indicators, users can gain insights into current production status and anticipated outcomes. It was developed to optimize solar power plant management, enabling informed decision-making and enhancing efficiency in renewable energy utilization
Key Features:
 - Graphical Production Displays: Users can visualize current and historical electricity production through interactive graphs.
 - Production Forecasting: The app employs advanced forecasting algorithms to predict future electricity production.
 - Organizations: Users can create organizations to manage multiple solar power plants under one umbrella.
 - Joining Organizations: Solar plant owners can join existing organizations to collaborate on production oversight and management.
 - Comprehensive Organization Production Overview: Enables viewing production forecasts across the entire organization, facilitating better organization and planning.
